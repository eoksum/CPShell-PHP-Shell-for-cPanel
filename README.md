# CPShell-PHP-Shell
for cPanel servers

CPShell is a PHP Shell that works on cPanel servers. It can crack account passwords and execute commands as of release 1.0 (more features coming soon) cpanel password cracker shell)

Usage is pretty basic. When you have filesystem access to a hosting account but you want full access to cPanel, you can upload this shell into web root and access it via browser like any other web shells. Then you can crack the account password or execute cmd commands.

More features coming soon.

CHANGELOG:

Current version is 1.0
It is initial release.
